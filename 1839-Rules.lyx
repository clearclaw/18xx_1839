 Lucas Boyd, Shelby Noonan and Chris Talbot for their bounteous supply of

 In particular John Bohrer unknowingly made an off-hand comment that directly
 lead to rescuing this design from the half-done dustbin, Lucas Boyd identified
 the core of the capital and pacing challenge in the game and greatly aided
 development, Shelby Noonan did much heavy lifting on this rules document
 and originated aspects of the train roster and what became the nationalisation
 system, and Chris Talbot suggested key parts of the private auction structure.
 Additional thanks and recognition go to the many other play-testers and
