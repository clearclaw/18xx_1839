This is an 18xx game. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX_games

Use `build.sh` to produce the art files for all the components.
Major dependencies:

  Ghostscript: http://www.ghostscript.com/
  LyX: http://lyx,.org/
  XXpaper: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?name=xxpaper

Print the components to match the counts listed in the rules.  This
will for instance, require printing four copies of the foreign shares
and then discarding down.  Likewise the trains will need discarding
down to match counts.

If producing the components with an Ellison Prestige Pro die cutter,
then use the *-nooutline-* files and delete the *-outline-* files.
Align the centre lines of your die with the cutlines at the centre of
each edge of the bounding box on each sheet.  But if cutting the
components by hand, reverse that and work entirely from the
*-outline-* files.

Exceptions:

  - If using a hand-punch for the token stickers, use the
    *-nooutline-* files for a cleaner result.

  - A revenue track is provided in each of two orientations.

I recommend printing the tokens on full-page lable stock, cutting with
a 1/2" PaperShaper punch and then mounting to wood plugs or discs.

Note: The ps18xx version of the map is not completely defined as
regards tile upgrade paths.  That will happen later.
