Print the coponents to matche the counts listed in the rules.  This
will, for instance, require printing four copies of the foreign shares
and then discarding down.

If producing the components with an Ellison Prestige Pro die cutter,
then use the *-nooutline-* files and delete the *-outline-* files.
Align the centre lines of your die with the cutlines at the centre of
each edge of the bounding box on each sheet.  But if cutting the
components by hand, reverse that.

Exceptions:

  - Use the outline market-* file.  The market-sheet1-nooutline.*
files are useless.

  - If using a hand-punch for the token stickers, use the
    *-nooutline-* files and you'll get a cleaner appearance.

Print and cut four (4) copies of the share_BEL-*, share_GER-* and
share_OVER-* files and then discard down to 10 single and 20 double
shares.

Similarly, print and cut one copy of each of the train sheets and
discard down to match the listed counts.

I recommend printing the tokens on full-page lable stock, cutting with
a 1/2" PaperShaper punch and then mounting to wood plugs or discs.
