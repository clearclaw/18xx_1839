1839: An 18xx game set in the Netherlands which features 16 public
companies of two different types, an unusual private auction and
private companies, nationaliastion, a novel stock market, an
aggressive train roster, no certificate limit and several other
curiousities.

A produced copy of the files ready for printing your own copy can be
found at: https://kanga.nu/~claw/1839/  

Six copies of the charter for the Koninklijke Fabriek van Stoom en
andere Werktuigen are provided, simply to fill the page.  Only one
copy is needed.  Two versions of the NS Government tokens are
provided, as I like the yellow, blue and red tokens, but some people
find them visually challenging.

If you make changes to this game under its Creative Commons license,
to components, art-files, the rules or anything else, please also
change the name of your new game to something other than "1839".

Note that under this license a commercial service cannot be used for
printing or making the game or any part of it.  License is given
solely for private reproduction of the game without the use of third
